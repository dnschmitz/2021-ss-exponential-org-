# Exponential Organisation

<span style="color:yellow">_By Silvia Martin and Dominique Schmitz_</span>

---
### Definition
* impact/output <span style="color:yellow">_at least 10 times larger_</span> compared to peers because of new organizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies

* grows faster, bigger and cheaper than competition because it has a  <span style="color:yellow">_Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)_</span> and scales as quickly as tech does

### Examples

---

### Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)

---

### Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)

capture heart and mind of people inside and outside the organization with a very aspirational position statement
not a mission statement

---

### MTP has the "power to pull" a community around the ExO

Creation of an ecosystem

### Examples of Cost Scale

3D printing

40.000$ in 2007 to 100$ in 2014: - 400% in 7 years

Industrial Robots

### Algorithms

---

### Leveraged Assets

---

### Engagement

---

### The internal attributes: IDEAS

---

### Interfaces

---

### Dashboards

### Characteristics 

| <span style="color:yellow">_Linear Organisation_</span>| <span style="color:yellow">_ExO_</span>| 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| Top-down & hierarchical in its orga | Autonomy, social technologies | 
| Driven by financial outcomes | MTP, dashboard |   
| Linear, sequential thinking | Experimentation, autonomy|
| Innovation primarily from within | Community & crowd, staff on demand, leveraged assets, interfaces (innovation at the edges) |

| strategic planning largely an extrapolation from the past | MTP, experimentation |
|Risk intolerance | Experimentation |
| Process inflexibility | Autonomy, experimentation |
| Large number of FTEs | Algorithms, community & crowd, staff om demand |
