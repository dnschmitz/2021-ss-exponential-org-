# Exponential Organisation

<span style="color:yellow">_By Silvia Martin and Dominique Schmitz_</span>

---

### Definition

- impact/output <span style="color:yellow">_at least 10 times larger_</span> compared to peers because of new organizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies

- grows faster, bigger and cheaper than competition because it has a <span style="color:yellow">_Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)_</span> and scales as quickly as tech does

---

Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR) of Kurzweiler:

- Moore's Law -> price/performance of information technology doubles every 18 months
- information-enabled and driven domains, disciplines, technologies and industries double their price/performance annually

### Examples

---

### Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)

---

### Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)

capture heart and mind of people inside and outside the organization with a very aspirational position statement
not a mission statement

---

### MTP has the "power to pull" a community around the ExO

Creation of an ecosystem

### Examples of Cost Scale

<u>Industrial Robots</u>

<span>$</span>500.000 in 2008 to <span>$</span>22.000 in 2013: - 23x in 5 years

<u>3D printing</u>

<span>$</span>40.000 in 2007 to <span>$</span>100 in 2014: - 400x in 7 years

<u>Biotech (DNA Sequencing)</u>

<span>$</span>10.000.000 in 2007 to <span>$</span>1.000 in 2014: - 10.000x in 7 years
