### <span style="color:#42affa">Ray Kurzweil's findings:</span>

- Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR) based on Moore's Law
- Information-enabled and driven objects double their price/performance annually
- Once the doubling pattern starts, it doesn't stop
- Modern key technologies are information-enabled and follow the same trajectory

### <span style="color:#42affa">Examples of Cost Scale</span>

![Cost scaling](costscaling.png)

---

### <span style="color:#42affa">Problem of the <em>Iridium moment</em>

- Applying linear tools, processes or trends of the past to predict the future.<br>
- Not able to predict exponential acceleration.

### <span style="color:#42affa">Who was right?</span>

<br/>
Kurzweil: 1% doubling every year = 100% in 7 years

### <span style="color:#42affa">Exponential Organizations (E<sub>x</sub>O)</span>

### <span style="color:#42affa">Characteristics</span>

- impact/output <span style="color:#bee4fd">_at least 10 times larger_</span> compared to peers because of new organizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies

- grows faster, bigger and cheaper than competition because it has a <span style="color:#bee4fd">_Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)_</span> and scales as quickly as tech does

---

### <span style="color:#42affa">Best Practice </span>

![Examples](MicrosoftTeams-image2.jpg)

---

- Even traditional industries are more and more information-enabled
- Disruptive breakthroughs occur when disparate fields cross

Marketplace for algorithms

Companies are matched with algorithms that can potentially make sense of their data.

---

### <span style="color:#42affa">Two types of algorithms:</span>

- <span style="color:#8dcffc"><em>Machine learning</em></span> based on training or historical data
- <span style="color:#8dcffc"><em>Deep learning</em></span> based on neural net technology

---

### <span style="color:#42affa">AI and algorithms compensate many heuristics in human cognition:</span>

- Anchoring bias
- Availability bias
- Confirmation bias
- Framing bias
- Optimism bias
- Planning fallacy bias
- Sunk-cost or loss-aversion bias
