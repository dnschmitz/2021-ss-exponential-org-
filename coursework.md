# Exponential Organisation

<span style="color:yellow">_By Silvia Martin and Dominique Schmitz_</span>

### Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR) of Kurzweiler:

- Moore's Law -> price/performance of information technology doubles every year or two
- information-enabled and driven domains, disciplines, technologies and industries double their price/performance annually
- Once the doubling pattern starts, it doesn't stop
- modern key technologies are information-enabled and follow the same trajectory

### Examples of Cost Scale

<u>Industrial Robots</u>

<span>$</span>500.000 in 2008 to <span>$</span>22.000 in 2013: - 23x in 5 years

<u>3D printing</u>

<span>$</span>40.000 in 2007 to <span>$</span>100 in 2014: - 400x in 7 years

<u>Biotech (DNA Sequencing)</u>

<span>$</span>10.000.000 in 2007 to <span>$</span>1.000 in 2014: - 10.000x in 7 years

Iridium moment: applying linear tools, processes, or trends of the past to predict an accelerating future. Iridium moment not able to predict exponential acceleration.

### Exponential Organizations (ExO)

Latest embodiment of acceleration

Companies that work in an information-based environment, that delivers fundamentally disruptive opportunities

---

### Definition

- impact/output <span style="color:yellow">_at least 10 times larger_</span> compared to peers because of new organizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies

- grows faster, bigger and cheaper than competition because it has a <span style="color:yellow">_Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)_</span> and scales as quickly as tech does

---

### Examples

![Examples](MicrosoftTeams-image2.jpg)

---

Even traditional industries are more and more information-enabled and with this disruption occurs

Disruptive breakthroughs occur when disparate fields cross

![Industrial revolution](Industrialrevolution.png)

---

### Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)

capture heart and mind of people inside and outside the organization with a very aspirational position statement
not a mission statement

---

#### Cisco

Mission statement "Shape the future of the Internet by creating unprecedented value and opportunity for our customers, employees, investors and ecosystem partners."

Possible MTP "Connecting everyone, everything, everywhere-all the time"

---

MTP must be unique and is advantageous to first movers

"We're <em>also</em> going to organize the world's information, but better."

---

### MTP has the "power to pull" a community around the ExO

Creation of an ecosystem
![Examples 2 ](IMG_077723.jpg)

---

### Why is an MTP important?

- Enables coherent exponential growth
- Binds collective aspiration
- Attracts top talent across the ecosystem
- Supports a cooperative/non-political culture
- Enables agility and learning

### The external attributes: SCALE

---

### Staff on demand

###### Rent, don't own

---

- Necessary characteristic for speed, functionality and flexibility in a fast-changing world.
- Most employees are risking to becoming obsolete and uncompetitive.
- Half-life of a learned skill was 30 years. Today it is about 5 years.

* Full-time workforce have the risk to fail to keep their skills up to date
* In any information-enabled business a large internal staff is increasingly unnecessary, counterproductive and expensive

---

Freelancers and contractors are increasingly needed

- Internet reduced the costs of finding and tracking staff
- The rise of number of internet users, rose the volume and quality of freelancers

---

Example of Gigwalk

Platform to find easily and fast large numbers of "employees" for small tasks

---

Example of Kaggle

Platform that hosts private and public algorithm contests
More than 185'000 data scientists worldwide vie for prizes and recognition

---

### Community and Crowd

---

"If you build communities and you do things in public, you don't have to find the right people, they find you"

Chris Anderson

---

Trait-based communities: use the internet to share intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs, risks and other characteristics, none of which depend on physical proximity.

---

For an organization or enterprise

Community = core team members + alumni + partners + vendors + customers + users + fans

---

How to build a community?

1. Use the MTP to attract and engage early members
2. Nurture the community
3. Create a platform to automate peer-to-peer engagement

To start fo companies it's easier to join an existing community that shares the same MTP

---

Crowd = concentric rings of people outside the core community. crowd is harder to reach but the numbers are greater

---

Staff on Demand = managed

Crowd = pull-based

---

How to leverage the crowd?

1. Creativity innovation - generate, develop and communicate new ideas by using tools and platforms
2. Validation - obtain measurable evidence about products' and services' success
3. Crowdfunding - help funding ideas using the internet to assemble many small investors (democratization of access to working capital)

---

###### Results of <em>Staff on Demand</em> and <em>Community & Crowd</em>

Core FTEs become smaller
Flexible workforce larger

Increased agility and better in learning and unlearning thanks to diversity and volume of flexible workforce

---

### Algorithms

---

### Leveraged Assets

---

Leasing everything has been used to shift assets from balance sheet

|          Past           |          Today          |
| :---------------------: | :---------------------: |
| Buildings and machinery | Mission-critical assets |

---

Example of TechShop

Collects expensive manufacturing machinery and offers subscribers a small monthly fee (<span>$</span>125 to <span>$</span>175, depending on the location) for unlimited access to its assets

Like gyms for expensive exercise equipment

---

ExOs are flexible a.o. because they don't own assets, even in strategic areas. This allows them to scale quickly as it obviates the need for staff to manage those assets.

---

Non-ownership is the key to owning the future, except, when it comes to scarce resources and assets.

Tesla owns its factories

Amazon owns its warehouses

---

When assets are information-based or commoditized at all, accessing is better than possessing.

---

### Engagement

---

### The internal attributes: IDEAS

![Example](MicrosoftTeams-image.png)

---

### Interfaces

- Process that closes gap between <span style="color:yellow">SCALE</span> externalities to internal <span style="color:yellow">IDEAS</span> control frameworks
- Interfaces are customised filtering and matching processes to process output of external attributes into internal organisation, using algorithms and workflow software

---

### Google's AdWords

![Example](MicrosoftTeams-image22.png) --> muss kleiner

---

### Dashboards

- Track and monitor performance using real-time metrics & performance tracking techniques

---

### Experimentation

---

### Autonomy

---

### Social Technologies
