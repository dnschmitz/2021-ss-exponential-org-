# <span style="color:#42affa">Exponential Organisation</span>

<span style="font-family:Papyrus; color:#bee4fd">_By Silvia Martin and Dominique Schmitz_</span>

üìà organization is üî• as üëø

"Any company designed for success in the 20<sup>th</sup> century is doomed to failure in the 21<sup>st</sup>."

David S. Rose

### <span style="color:#42affa">Ray Kurzweil's findings of Kurzweil:</span>

- Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR) based on Moore's Law
- Once the doubling pattern starts, it doesn't stop
- Information-enabled and driven objects double their price/performance annually
- Modern key technologies are information-enabled and follow the same trajectory

### <span style="color:#42affa">Examples of Cost Scale</span>

![Cost scaling](costscaling.png)

---

### Problem of the <em>Iridium moment</em>

Applying linear tools, processes, or trends of the past to predict an accelerating future. Iridium moment is not able to predict exponential acceleration.

![Kurzweil example](Kurzweil2.png)

---

### <span style="color:#42affa">Who was right?</span>

<br/>
Kurzweil: 1% doubling every year = 100% in 7 years

# <span style="color:yellow"> üëç</span>

### <span style="color:#42affa">Exponential Organizations (E<sub>x</sub>O)</span>

Latest embodiment of acceleration

Companies that work in an information-based environment, that delivers fundamentally disruptive opportunities

---

### <span style="color:#42affa">Characteristics</span>

- impact/output <span style="color:#bee4fd">_at least 10 times larger_</span> compared to peers because of new organizational techniques that leverage accelerating technologies

- grows faster, bigger and cheaper than competition because it has a <span style="color:#bee4fd">_Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)_</span> and scales as quickly as tech does

---

### <span style="color:#42affa">Best Practice </span>

![Examples](MicrosoftTeams-image2.jpg)

---

Even traditional industries are more and more information-enabled

Disruptive breakthroughs occur when disparate fields cross

![Industrial revolution](Industrialrevolution.png)

### <span style="color:#42affa">Massive Transformative Purpose (MTP)</span>

capture <span style="color:red">‚ù§Ô∏è</span> and <span style="color:pink">üë®</span> of people inside and outside the organization with a very aspirational position statement

---

<img src="cisco.png" alt="cisco" width="200"/>

<span style="color:#bee4fd">Mission statement</span><br>
"Shape the future of the Internet by creating unprecedented value and opportunity for our customers, employees, investors and ecosystem partners."

<br>
<span style="color:#bee4fd">Possible MTP</span><br>
"Connecting everyone, everything, everywhere-all the time"

---

MTP must be unique and is advantageous to first movers

"We're <em>also</em> going to organize the world's information, but better."

---

### <span style="color:#42affa">MTP has the "power to pull" a community around the ExO</span>

Creation of an ecosystem
![Examples 2 ](IMG_0792.gif)

---

### <span style="color:#42affa">Why is an MTP important?</span>

- Enables coherent exponential growth
- Binds collective aspiration
- Attracts top talent across the ecosystem
- Supports a cooperative/non-political culture
- Enables agility and learning

### <span style="color:#42affa">Community and Crowd</span>

---

"If you build communities and you do things in public, you don't have to find the right people, they find you"

Chris Anderson

---

Community

Core team members + alumni + partners + vendors + customers + users + fans

---

### <span style="color:#42affa">How to build a community?</span>

1. Use the MTP to attract and engage early members
2. Nurture the community
3. Create a platform to automate peer-to-peer engagement

To start for companies it's easier to join an existing community that shares the same MTP

---

Crowd

Concentric rings of people outside the core community. Crowd is harder to reach but the numbers are greater
Crowd is pull-based, while Staff on Demand is managed

PIC

---

<span style="color:#42affa">How to leverage the crowd?</span>

1. Creativity innovation - generate, develop and communicate new ideas by using tools and platforms
2. Validation - obtain measurable evidence about products' and services' success
3. Crowdfunding - help funding ideas using the internet to assemble many small investors (democratization of access to working capital)

---

###### Results of <em>Staff on Demand</em> and <em>Community & Crowd</em>

Core FTEs become smaller
Flexible workforce larger

Increased agility and better in learning and unlearning thanks to diversity and volume of flexible workforce

---

### <span style="color:#42affa">Algorithms</span>

---

Today the world is run by algorithms:

- Automotive anti-lock braking
- Recommendation engine of Amazon
- Dynamic pricing of airlines
- Success predictions of upcoming blockbusters
- Writing new posts
- Air traffic control
- Credit card fraud detection
- ...

---

Marketplace for algorithms
Companies are matched with algorithms that can potentially make sense of their data.

---

Two types of algorithms:

- <em>Machine learning</em> based on training or historical data
- <em>Deep learning</em> based on neural net technology

PICs with examples

Technology will make most products and services more effective, personalized and efficient impacting and disrupting many white-collar jobs.

---

AI and algorithms compensate many heuristics in human cognition:

- Anchoring bias
- Availability bias
- Confirmation bias
- Framing bias
- Optimism bias
- Planning fallacy bias
- Sunk-cost or loss-aversion bias

---

How can ExOs implement algorithms?

1. <strong>Gather</strong> data via sensors, humans or import them from public databases
2. <strong>Organize</strong> the data --> ETL (Extract, Transform and Load)
3. <strong>Apply</strong> machine learning tools (eg. Hadoop and Pivotal) or deep learning algorithms (eg. DeepMind, Vicarious and SkyMind)
4. <strong>Expose</strong> the data and APIs to the ExO community to develop new services, functionalities and innovation on top of the existing platform

### <span style="color:#42affa">Leveraged Assets</span>

---

Leasing everything has been used to shift assets from balance sheet

| <span style="color:#42affa">Past</span> | <span style="color:#42affa">Present</span> |
| :-------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------: |
|         Buildings and machinery         |          Mission-critical assets           |

---

### <span style="color:#42affa">Example of TechShop</span>

Collects expensive manufacturing machinery and offers subscribers a small monthly fee (<span>$</span>125 to <span>$</span>175, depending on the location) for unlimited access to its assets

Like gyms for expensive exercise equipment

---

ExOs are flexible a.o. because they don't own assets, even in strategic areas. This allows them to scale quickly as it obviates the need for staff to manage those assets.

---

Non-ownership is the key to owning the future, except, when it comes to scarce resources and assets.

Tesla owns its factories

Amazon owns its warehouses

---

When assets are information-based or commoditized at all, accessing is better than possessing.

---

### <span style="color:#42affa">Engagement</span>

---

Past: Sweepstakes, quizzes, coupons, airline miles and loyalty card --> "Employee of the Month" programmes

Present: techniques have been fully information-enabled, elaborated and socialized, in form of digital reputation systems, games and incentive prizes<br>
Examples: Google, Airbnb, Uber, eBay, Yelp, GitHub and Twitter

---

What makes engagement so advantageous?

- Ranking transparency
- Self-efficacy
- Peer pressure
- Eliciting positive rather than negative emotions to drive long-term behavioral change
- Instant feedback
- Clear, authentic rules, goals and rewards
- Virtual currencies or points

---

For Millennials, gaming is a way of life

"Gamification should empower people, not exploit them. It should feel good at the end of the day because you made progress towards something that mattered to you."

Jane McGonigal

---

Gamification used as a hiring tool

Example: Google and Domino's Pizza

Gamification to improve company's internal culture

Example: Pep Boys

---

Gamification to encourage competition

Example: X Prize Foundation

HeroX allows companies to create their own challenges to solve local and global issues.

---

Positive side effect of engagement is TRAINING

Complexity of some games provide education in leadership and teamwork skills.

Becoming a WOW guild master = total-immersion course in leadership

---

Engagement is a key element for scaling the organization in crowd and community and creating external network effects.

ExO needs to optimize the engagement of crowd and community, otherwise it will wither and fade.
